Sophon Software Stack
=====================

In response to the series of TPU products mentioned in the previous section, 
Bitmain independently developed a set of suitable software tools:
Bitmain Neural Network Software Development Kit(BMNNSDK).

The softwares for using Sophon TPUs are all included in BMNNSDK.
Sophon Inference, which supplies a bunch of high level APIs, 
is a upper module in BMNNSDK to help user deploying their models on Sophon TPUs rapidly.

In this section, we first show you the pipeline of deploying deep learning models on Sophon TPUs.
Then, we introduce the base concepts of BMNNSDK and Sophon Inference.
Last is the installation and some reminds.
