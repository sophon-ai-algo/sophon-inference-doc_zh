C++ Samples Using BMNNSDK
=========================

VPU decode
__________

**Introduction**

This sample program implements reading a local video file,
and drive the VPU hardware unit on the Sophon Deep Learning Acceleration Card to decode the video file.

The program source file is located under: "samples/cpp_bmnnsdk/vpu_decode".

**Execution**

    .. code-block:: shell

       # -v Local video file to be decoded.
       # -t The number of threads that need to be opened, 
       #    each thread independently decodes a copy of the video file.
       # -i The serial number of the SC3 to be used on host.
       ./build/bin/vpu_decode -v $HOME/.sophon/data/fenix5plus.mp4 -t 1 -i 0

run_inceptionv1
_______________

**Introduction**

This sample program implements deploying the inceptionv1 classification model on the Sophon TPU.
The inceptionv1 comes from the caffe official model zoo.
Since the program is written based on the native interfaces provided by BMNNSDK, 
if you have questions about the details of the interface,
please refer to the "NNToolChain User Documentation".

The program source file is located under: "samples/cpp_bmnnsdk/run_inceptionv1".

**Execution**

    .. code-block:: shell

       # Download and convert model, generate bmodel file.
       python3 tools/download_and_convert.py googlenet

       # load bmodelï¼Œdrive TPU to complete reasoning.
       ./build/bin/run_inceptionv1 $HOME/.sophon/models/googlenet_ir $HOME/.sophon/data/cls_imgs/cls_1.jpg
