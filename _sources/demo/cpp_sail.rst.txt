C++ Samples Using SAIL
======================

Image Classification
____________________

**Introduction**

This sample program compiles three classification models into bmodels, respectively.
Then load the three bmodels separately to drive the TPU reasoning.
The three models are: mobilenetv1(caffe), resnet50(caffe), mobilenetv1(tensorflow).

Source codes are located under: samples/cpp_sail/img_cls

For parameters' configuration, see: saples/cpp_sail/config/cls_imagenet.ini

**Execution**

    .. code-block:: shell

       # download and convert models to generate bmodel
       # mobilenetv1 (caffe)
       python3 tools/download_and_convert.py mobilenetv1
       # resnet50 (caffe)
       python3 tools/download_and_convert.py resnet50
       # mobilenetv1 (tensorflow)
       python3 tools/download_and_convert.py mobilenetv1_tf

       # drive TPU to reason
       build/bin/img_cls


Object Detection
________________

**Introduction**

The sample program contains three programs for object detection of images and video.

**1). det_voc_image**

The program deploys mobilenetv1_ssd (caffe) on the TPU and enables detection of a single image.

Source codes are located under: samples/cpp_sail/det_voc_image

For parameters' configuration, see: samples/cpp_sail/config/det_voc_image.ini

    .. code-block:: shell
    
       # Dowload and convert model
       python3 tools/download_and_convert.py mobilenetssd

       # Drive TPU to reason
       build/bin/det_voc_image

**2). det_voc_video**

The program deploys mobilenetv1_ssd (caffe) on the TPU and enables detection of images decoded from a local video file using VPU.

Source codes are located under: samples/cpp_sail/det_voc_video

For parameters' configuration, see: samples/cpp_sail/config/det_voc_video.ini

    .. code-block:: shell

       # Download and convert model
       python3 tools/download_and_convert.py mobilenetssd

       # drive VPU to decode and driver TPU to reason
       build/bin/det_voc_video

**3). det_yolov3**

The program deploys yolov3 (caffe) on the TPU and enables detection of a single image.

Source codes are located under: samples/cpp_sail/det_yolov3

For parameters' configuration, see: samples/cpp_sail/config/det_yolov3.ini

    .. code-block:: shell

       # Download and Convert model
       python3 ./tools/download_and_convert.py yolov3

       # Drive TPU to reason
       build/bin/det_yolov3

Face Detection
______________

The program deploys the mtcnn (caffe) model on the TPU,
and realize face detection on a single image.

Source codes are located under: samples/cpp_sail/det_mtcnn

For parameters' configuration, see: samples/cpp_sail/config/det_mtcnn.ini

    .. code-block:: shell

       # Download and Convert model
       python3 ./tools/download_and_convert.py mtcnn

       # Drive TPU to reason
       build/bin/det_mtcnn
